 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,2,1]\n[2,2]'
 *
 * Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
 * Output: [2,2]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
 * Output: [4,9]
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both
 * arrays.
 * The result can be in any order.
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * 
 * 
 * What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your
 * algorithm?
 * What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is
 * better?
 * What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such
 * that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
 *
