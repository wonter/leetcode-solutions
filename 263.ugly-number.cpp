 *
 * Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.
 * 
 * Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 6
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 8
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: 8 = 2 × 2 × 2
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 14
 * Output: false 
 * Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
 * Input is within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1].
